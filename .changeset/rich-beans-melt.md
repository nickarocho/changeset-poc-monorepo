# MAJOR RELEASE 🎉🎉🎉

## What changed?

_Glad you asked. Let's break it down._

---

First up, `Dog` leveled up - big time.

### Dog

`Dog` used to be a regular old fluffy poodle.

```
🐩.
```

However, `Dog` (being the overachiever she is) aspired to become a trusty service dog. So after years of dedicated training, we are excited to announce that `Dog` is now - officially:

```
🦮
```

This brings lots of exciting new stuff to the `Dog` package, including:

- Helping elderly and vision-impaired people cross busy streets
- A sweet new vest that bears the title "SERVICE `DOG`"
- Priority boarding on all flights
- A deep sense of pride and accomplishment

---

If you thought that was exciting, wait 'til you hear about Cat's major upgrades.

### Cat

`Cat`, as great as he was, didn't really have much of a funny bone.

But after we introduced some newly generated, potent, genetically-engineered catnip to him, he finally gained a heightened (and, frankly, very welcomed) sense of humor.

#### The following attempts to get a chuckle out of `Cat` were unsuccessful, resulting in a `grumpyCat` output:

- [x] ~~tickling his belly~~
- [x] ~~[throwing cucumbers at him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2acZIOSV9LY)~~
- [x] ~~dad jokes~~
- [x] ~~binging episodes of The Office~~
- [x] ~~anti-jokes~~
- [x] ~~top ten YouTube fail vids~~

NOTHING. Still, `Cat` was simply:

```
🐈
```

But after much R&D with different types of enhanced catnip which targets humor receptors in the pre-frontal cortex of feline brains, we are excited to announce that `Cat` is clinically-hysterical:

```
😹
```

Also, cats can't do math, so we removed the `add` function from `Cat`'s package.

If you still want to perform impressive math calculations, you can import the function from our `/core` package like so:

```js
import { add } from "@nickarocho-js-changeset-poc/core";

const impressiveMathCalculation = sum(123, 456); // returns math
```

---

Hope you enjoy the upgraded packages!
