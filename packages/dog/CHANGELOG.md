### Major Changes

- f7a074b: # MAJOR RELEASE 🎉🎉🎉

  ## What changed?

  _Glad you asked. Let's break it down._

  ***

  ### Dog

  `Dog` used to be a regular old fluffy poodle.

  ```
  🐩.
  ```

  However, `Dog` (being the overachiever she is) aspired to become a trusty service dog. So after years of dedicated training, we are excited to announce that `Dog` is now - officially:

  ```
  🦮
  ```

  This brings lots of exciting new stuff to the `Dog` package, including:

  - Helping elderly and vision-impaired people cross busy streets
  - A sweet new vest that bears the title "SERVICE `DOG`"
  - Priority boarding on all flights
  - A deep sense of pride and accomplishment

  ***

  Hope you enjoy the upgraded packages!
