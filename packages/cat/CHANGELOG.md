### Major Changes

- f7a074b: # MAJOR RELEASE 🎉🎉🎉

  ## What changed?

  _Glad you asked. Let's break it down._

  `Cat`, as great as he was, didn't really have much of a funny bone.

  But after we introduced some newly generated, potent, genetically-engineered catnip to him, he finally gained a heightened (and, frankly, very welcomed) sense of humor.

  #### The following attempts to get a chuckle out of `Cat` were unsuccessful, resulting in a `grumpyCat` output:

  - [x] ~~tickling his belly~~
  - [x] ~~[throwing cucumbers at him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2acZIOSV9LY)~~
  - [x] ~~dad jokes~~
  - [x] ~~binging episodes of The Office~~
  - [x] ~~anti-jokes~~
  - [x] ~~top ten YouTube fail vids~~

  NOTHING. Still, `Cat` was simply:

  ```
  🐈
  ```

  But after much R&D with different types of enhanced catnip which targets humor receptors in the pre-frontal cortex of feline brains, we are excited to announce that `Cat` is clinically-hysterical:

  ```
  😹
  ```

  Also, cats can't do math, so we removed the `add` function from `Cat`'s package.

  If you still want to perform impressive math calculations, you can import the function from our `/core` package like so:

  ```js
  import { add } from "@nickarocho-js-changeset-poc/core";

  const impressiveMathCalculation = sum(123, 456); // returns math
  ```

  Hope you enjoy the upgraded packages!

  ## Example

  It looks something like this:

  ```js
  import { add } from "@nickarocho-js-changeset-poc/core";
