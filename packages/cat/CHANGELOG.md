### Major Changes

- f7a074b: # MAJOR RELEASE üéâüéâüéâ

  ## What changed?

  _Glad you asked. Let's break it down._

  ***

  First up, `Dog` leveled up - big time.

  ### Dog

  `Dog` used to be a regular old fluffy poodle.

  ```
  üê©.
  ```

  However, `Dog` (being the overachiever she is) aspired to become a trusty service dog. So after years of dedicated training, we are excited to announce that `Dog` is now - officially:

  ```
  ü¶Æ
  ```

  This brings lots of exciting new stuff to the `Dog` package, including:

  - Helping elderly and vision-impaired people cross busy streets
  - A sweet new vest that bears the title "SERVICE `DOG`"
  - Priority boarding on all flights
  - A deep sense of pride and accomplishment

  ***

  If you thought that was exciting, wait 'til you hear about Cat's major upgrades.

  ### Cat

  `Cat`, as great as he was, didn't really have much of a funny bone.

  But after we introduced some newly generated, potent, genetically-engineered catnip to him, he finally gained a heightened (and, frankly, very welcomed) sense of humor.

  #### The following attempts to get a chuckle out of `Cat` were unsuccessful, resulting in a `grumpyCat` output:

  - [x] ~~tickling his belly~~
  - [x] ~~[throwing cucumbers at him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2acZIOSV9LY)~~
  - [x] ~~dad jokes~~
  - [x] ~~binging episodes of The Office~~
  - [x] ~~anti-jokes~~
  - [x] ~~top ten YouTube fail vids~~

  NOTHING. Still, `Cat` was simply:

  ```
  üêà
  ```

  But after much R&D with different types of enhanced catnip which targets humor receptors in the pre-frontal cortex of feline brains, we are excited to announce that `Cat` is clinically-hysterical:

  ```
  üòπ
  ```

  Also, cats can't do math, so we removed the `add` function from `Cat`'s package.

  If you still want to perform impressive math calculations, you can import the function from our `/core` package like so:

  ```js
  import { add } from "@nickarocho-js-changeset-poc/core";

  const impressiveMathCalculation = sum(123, 456); // returns math
  ```

  ***

  Hope you enjoy the upgraded packages!
